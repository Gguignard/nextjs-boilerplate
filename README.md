Script allowing to copy boilerplate in templates folder to any project

## Getting Started

To use it in local.

Inside this folder :

```bash
npm link
```

Then on the dedicated folder run :

```bash
create-next-template my-app
```

It will create a folder called `my-app` and then copy all files.
You can also run it without the folder name in this case it will copy all files in your current folder.
